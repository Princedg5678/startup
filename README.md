I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **JavaScript** - Provides login, choice display, applying votes, display other users votes, backend endpoint calls.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
  - login
  - retrieving choices
  - submitting votes
  - retrieving vote status
- **DB/Login** - Store restaurant owners live info
- **WebSocket** - As each user votes, update the votes live.
- **React** - Application ported to use the React web framework.
