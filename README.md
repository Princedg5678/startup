### Elevator pitch

My restaurant, The Blast Zone Cafe, a futuristic-themed restaurant known for creative food that explodes with flavor (not literally, of course), will increase business by making customers excited to participate in deciding what new, innovative food items will be added to the menu. During the promotion, users will get to choose three new menu items from the descriptions on the restaurantâ€™s website that they would like to see added to the regular menu. During the promotion period, the current voting statistics for each potential new menu item will be displayed. At the end of the promotion, the top three menu items with the most votes will be added to The Blast Zone Cafe menu.
